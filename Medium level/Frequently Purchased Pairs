Assume you are given the following tables on Walmart transactions and products. 
Find the number of unique product combinations that are bought together (purchased in the same transaction).

For example, if I find two transactions where apples and bananas are bought, and another transaction where bananas and soy milk are bought,
my output would be 2 to represent the 2 unique combinations. Your output should be a single number.

Assumption:
For each transaction, a maximum of 2 products is purchased.

transactions Table:
Column Name	Type
transaction_id	integer
product_id	integer
user_id	integer
transaction_date	datetime

transactions Example Input:

There are 4 unique purchase combinations present in the example data.

Answer : 
WITH tb1 AS (
SELECT 
  transactions.user_id, 
  transactions.product_id, 
  transactions.transaction_id, 
  products.product_name 
FROM transactions
INNER JOIN products 
  ON transactions.product_id = products.product_id
), 
tb2 AS(
SELECT *
FROM tb1 AS table_1
INNER JOIN tb1 AS table_2
  ON table_1.transaction_id = table_2.transaction_id
  AND table_1.product_id > table_2.product_id)
  
SELECT COUNT(*) AS combo_num FROM tb2;
