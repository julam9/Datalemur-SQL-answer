A Microsoft Azure Supercloud customer is a company which buys at least 1 product from each product category.

Write a query to report the company ID which is a Supercloud customer.

As of 5 Dec 2022, data in the customer_contracts and products tables were updated.

customer_contracts Table:
Column Name	Type
customer_id	integer
product_id	integer
amount	integer

customer_contracts Example Input:
customer_id	product_id	amount
1	1	1000
1	3	2000
1	5	1500
2	2	3000
2	6	2000

products Table:
Column Name	Type
product_id	integer
product_category	string
product_name	string

products Example Input:
product_id	product_category	product_name
1	Analytics	Azure Databricks
2	Analytics	Azure Stream Analytics
4	Containers	Azure Kubernetes Service
5	Containers	Azure Service Fabric
6	Compute	Virtual Machines
7	Compute	Azure Functions

Example Output:
customer_id
1

Explanation:
Customer 1 bought from Analytics, Containers, and Compute categories of Azure, and thus is a Supercloud customer.
Customer 2 isn't a Supercloud customer, since they don't buy any container services from Azure.

Answer :
WITH tb1 AS( 
SELECT cc.customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT p.product_category) AS unique_count 
FROM customer_contracts cc 
LEFT JOIN products p  
ON cc.product_id = p.product_id 
GROUP BY cc.customer_id)

SELECT customer_id AS superloud_customers
FROM tb1 
WHERE unique_count = (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_category) 
  FROM products)
ORDER BY customer_id;
