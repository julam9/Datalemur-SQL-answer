Assume there are three Spotify tables containing information about the artists, songs, and music charts. 
Write a query to determine the top 5 artists whose songs appear in the Top 10 of the global_song_rank table the highest number of times. 
From now on, we'll refer to this ranking number as "song appearances".

Output the top 5 artist names in ascending order along with their song appearances ranking (not the number of song appearances, 
but the rank of who has the most appearances). The order of the rank should take precedence.

For example, Ed Sheeran's songs appeared 5 times in Top 10 list of the global song rank table; 
this is the highest number of appearances, so he is ranked 1st. Bad Bunny's songs appeared in the list 4, so he comes in at a close 2nd.

Assumptions:
If two artists' songs have the same number of appearances, the artists should have the same rank.
The rank number should be continuous (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5) and not skipped (1, 2, 2, 4, 5).

artists Table:
Column Name	Type
artist_id	integer
artist_name	varchar

artists Example Input:
artist_id	artist_name
101	Ed Sheeran
120	Drake

songs Table:
Column Name	Type
song_id	integer
artist_id	integer

songs Example Input:
song_id	artist_id
45202	101
19960	120

global_song_rank Table:
Column Name	Type
day	integer (1-52)
song_id	integer
rank	integer (1-1,000,000)

global_song_rank Example Input:
day	song_id	rank
1	45202	5
3	45202	2
1	19960	3
9	19960	15

Example Output:
artist_name	artist_rank
Ed Sheeran	1
Drake	2

Explanation
Ed Sheeran's song appeared twice in the Top 10 list of global song rank while Drake's song is only listed once. Therefore, Ed is ranked #1 and Drake is ranked #2.

Answer :
WITH tb_1 AS (
SELECT a.artist_id as artist_id, a.artist_name AS artist_name, 
  COUNT(gsr.song_id) AS song_appear
  FROM artists a  
  JOIN songs s
  ON a.artist_id = s.artist_id
  JOIN global_song_rank gsr 
  ON s.song_id = gsr.song_id
  WHERE gsr.rank <= 10
  GROUP BY a.artist_id, a.artist_name
  ),
tb_2 AS( 
SELECT artist_name, 
  DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY song_appear DESC) AS artist_rank
FROM tb_1)

SELECT *
FROM tb_2
WHERE artist_rank IN (1,2,3,4,5)
ORDER BY artist_rank, artist_name
