Assume you have an events table on app analytics. Write a query to get the appâ€™s click-through rate (CTR %) in 2022. 
Output the results in percentages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:
Percentage of click-through rate = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, you should multiply the click-through rate by 100.0, not 100.

events Table:
Column Name	Type
app_id	integer
event_type	string
timestamp	datetime

events Example Input:
app_id	event_type	timestamp
123	impression	07/18/2022 11:36:12
123	impression	07/18/2022 11:37:12
123	click	07/18/2022 11:37:42
234	impression	07/18/2022 14:15:12
234	click	07/18/2022 14:16:12

Example Output:
app_id	ctr
123	50.00
234	100.00

Explanation
App 123 has a CTR of 50.00% because this app receives 1 click out of the 2 impressions. Hence, it's 1/2 = 50.00%.

Answer :
SELECT app_id,
ROUND(100.0* COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type='click' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END)/ 
COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END), 2)  
FROM events
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp) = 2022
GROUP BY app_id;
