Assume you have the table below containing information on Facebook user actions. 
Write a query to obtain the active user retention in July 2022. Output the month (in numerical format 1, 2, 3) and the number of monthly active users (MAUs).

Hint: An active user is a user who has user action ("sign-in", "like", or "comment") in the current month and last month.

user_actions Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
event_id	integer
event_type	string ("sign-in, "like", "comment")
event_date	datetime

user_actionsExample Input:
user_id	event_id	event_type	event_date
445	7765	sign-in	05/31/2022 12:00:00
742	6458	sign-in	06/03/2022 12:00:00
445	3634	like	06/05/2022 12:00:00
742	1374	comment	06/05/2022 12:00:00
648	3124	like	06/18/2022 12:00:00

Example Output for June 2022:
month	monthly_active_users
6	1

Example
In June 2022, there was only one monthly active user (MAU), user_id 445.

Note: We are showing you output for June 2022 as the user_actions table only have event_dates in June 2022. You should work out the solution for July 2022.

Answer : 
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date) AS month,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS monthly_active_users
FROM user_actions AS curr_month
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT last_month.user_id
  FROM user_actions AS last_month
  WHERE last_month.user_id = curr_month.user_id
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM last_month.event_date) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date - interval '1 month')
)
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date) = 7
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM curr_month.event_date) = 2022
GROUP BY month;
